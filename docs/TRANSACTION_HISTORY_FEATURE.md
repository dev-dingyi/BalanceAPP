## üîß Technical Implementation

### State Management
```tsx
// Filter state
const [searchQuery, setSearchQuery] = useState('');
const [categoryFilter, setCategoryFilter] = useState('all');
const [startDate, setStartDate] = useState('');
const [endDate, setEndDate] = useState('');
const [sortBy, setSortBy] = useState<'date' | 'amount'>('date');
const [sortOrder, setSortOrder] = useState<'asc' | 'desc'>('desc');

// Pagination state
const [page, setPage] = useState(0);
const [rowsPerPage, setRowsPerPage] = useState(10);

// Dialog state
const [editDialogOpen, setEditDialogOpen] = useState(false);
const [deleteDialogOpen, setDeleteDialogOpen] = useState(false);
const [selectedTransaction, setSelectedTransaction] = useState<Transaction | null>(null);
```

### Performance Optimization
- **useMemo** for filtered transactions (prevents re-computation)
- **useMemo** for statistics (calculated once per filter change)
- **useMemo** for paginated results
- **Lazy loading** via React.lazy()
- **Code splitting** - Only loads when route accessed

### Data Flow
1. **Fetch** transactions from Firestore (useTransactions hook)
2. **Transform** with stealth mode (useStealthMode hook)
3. **Filter** by search, category, date range
4. **Sort** by selected criterion
5. **Paginate** for display
6. **Calculate** statistics from filtered results
