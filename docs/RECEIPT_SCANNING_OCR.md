# Receipt Scanning & OCR Feature

**Status**: ✅ Completed
**Date**: October 12, 2025

## Overview

Implemented a comprehensive receipt scanning system that combines **Tesseract.js OCR** with **Claude AI** for intelligent receipt parsing. Users can now scan physical receipts using their camera or upload images, and the system will automatically extract transaction details.

## Architecture

### Two-Tier Parsing System

1. **Tier 1: OCR Text Extraction** (Tesseract.js)
   - Extracts raw text from receipt images
   - Supports English and Chinese characters
   - Processes images client-side (no server upload needed)
   - Real-time progress tracking

2. **Tier 2: Intelligent Parsing** (Claude AI + Fallback)
   - **Primary**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet AI parses extracted text
   - **Fallback**: Regex-based parsing if AI unavailable
   - Auto-detects: merchant, amount, date, time, currency
   - Suggests appropriate category based on context

## Features Implemented

### 1. OCR Service (`/web-app/src/services/ocrService.ts`)

**Core OCR Functionality**:
- `extractText()` - Extract text from images using Tesseract.js
- Supports English (`eng`) and Chinese Simplified (`chi_sim`)
- Progress tracking during recognition
- Lazy initialization for performance

**AI-Powered Parsing**:
- `parseReceiptWithAI()` - Uses Claude AI to intelligently parse receipt text
- Detects merchant names, amounts, currencies, dates, times
- Maps to appropriate categories from user's category list
- Returns confidence score for accuracy

**Fallback Parsing**:
- `parseReceiptBasic()` - Regex-based parsing when AI unavailable
- Pattern matching for common receipt formats
- Detects total amounts, currencies, dates, times
- Language-agnostic patterns (English + Chinese)

**Full Workflow**:
- `scanReceipt()` - Complete end-to-end workflow
- Step 1: OCR extraction
- Step 2: AI or fallback parsing
- Step 3: Return structured transaction data

### 2. Receipt Scanner Component (`/web-app/src/components/receipt/ReceiptScanner.tsx`)

**User Interface**:
- Clean, intuitive upload interface
- Drag & drop support (via file input)
- Camera capture for mobile devices
- Image preview before processing
- Real-time progress indicators

**Features**:
- Two upload modes:
  - 📷 **Take Photo**: Direct camera access (mobile-friendly)
  - 📁 **Upload Image**: File picker for gallery/desktop
- Linear progress bar with status messages:
  - "Processing image..."
  - "Extracting text from receipt..."
  - "Parsing transaction data..."
- Success confirmation before auto-fill
- Error handling with clear messages
- Ability to cancel and retry

**Visual Feedback**:
- Badge showing mode: "Claude AI + OCR" or "OCR Only"
- Image preview with close button
- Loading overlay during processing
- Success alert on completion
- Info alerts explaining capabilities

### 3. Integration with AddTransaction Page

**Three Input Methods** (now available):
1. ✨ **AI Smart Input** - Natural language text input
2. 📸 **Receipt Scanner** - OCR + AI parsing
3. ✏️ **Manual Entry** - Traditional form fields

**Workflow**:
- Receipt scanner appears as third option
- Click "Scan Receipt" button to expand scanner
- Upload or capture receipt image
- System processes and auto-fills form
- User can review/adjust before saving
- Seamless integration with existing form

**Auto-Fill Behavior**:
```typescript
{
  amount: extracted from receipt
  currency: detected (USD/CNY)
  description: merchant name or items
  date: from receipt or current date
  time: from receipt or current time
  location: merchant name (if available)
  categoryId: AI-suggested category (if available)
}
```

- Medium receipt (1024x768): ~4-8 seconds
- Large receipt (2048x1536): ~8-15 seconds
- Varies by device CPU

**Memory Usage**:
- Tesseract worker: ~50-100 MB
- Image processing: Depends on image size
- Worker is lazy-loaded (only when needed)

## Usage Guide

### For Users

1. **Navigate to "Add Transaction" page**

2. **Click "Scan Receipt" button** (between AI Smart Input and manual form)

3. **Choose upload method**:
   - Mobile: Tap "Take Photo" to use camera
   - Desktop: Click "Upload Image" to select file

4. **Wait for processing**:
   - Progress bar shows current step
   - Takes 2-15 seconds depending on image size

5. **Review auto-filled form**:
   - Check extracted amount, date, description
   - Adjust category if needed
   - Verify all fields

6. **Submit transaction** as normal

### Tips for Best Results

**Image Quality**:
- ✅ Good lighting (avoid shadows)
- ✅ Receipt laid flat (no wrinkles)
- ✅ All text visible and in focus
- ✅ High contrast (dark text on white paper)
- ❌ Avoid: blurry images, low light, angled shots

**Receipt Types that Work Well**:
- ✅ Printed thermal receipts
- ✅ Restaurant receipts
- ✅ Retail store receipts
- ✅ Gas station receipts
- ⚠️ Handwritten receipts (lower accuracy)
- ⚠️ Faded receipts (may require manual entry)

## AI-Powered Features (with Anthropic API Key)

When `VITE_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is configured:

1. **Intelligent Merchant Detection**
   - Extracts business name from various receipt formats
   - Handles different languages and formats

2. **Accurate Amount Detection**
   - Finds total amount (ignores subtotals, tax lines)
   - Understands various currency formats

3. **Smart Category Suggestion**
   - Analyzes merchant type (restaurant, gas, grocery, etc.)
   - Maps to user's existing categories
   - Provides confidence score

4. **Date/Time Extraction**
   - Parses various date formats
   - Handles multiple languages
   - Falls back to current date/time if not found

5. **Contextual Understanding**
   - Understands receipt structure
   - Ignores irrelevant text (ads, terms, etc.)
   - Focuses on transaction details

## Fallback Mode (without API Key)

Without Claude AI, the system uses regex-based parsing:

**What Works**:
- ✅ Total amount extraction
- ✅ Currency detection
- ✅ Basic date/time extraction
- ✅ Simple merchant name detection

**Limitations**:
- ⚠️ No category suggestion
- ⚠️ Less accurate with complex receipts
- ⚠️ May require manual adjustment

**Users are notified**: Badge shows "OCR Only" instead of "Claude AI + OCR"

## Error Handling

**Common Errors & Solutions**:

1. **"No text found in image"**
   - Solution: Ensure image is clear and well-lit
   - Try again with better lighting

2. **"Could not detect total amount"**
   - Solution: OCR worked but parsing failed
   - Manually enter amount from preview

3. **"Please select an image file"**
   - Solution: Only image files accepted
   - Use JPEG, PNG, or WebP

4. **"OCR worker not initialized"**
   - Solution: Rare initialization error
   - Refresh page and try again

5. **"Failed to scan receipt"**
   - Solution: General error (network, memory, etc.)
   - Check browser console for details
   - Try with smaller image

## Security & Privacy

**Client-Side Processing**:
- ✅ OCR runs entirely in browser
- ✅ Images never uploaded to OCR servers
- ✅ No data sent to third parties (except Claude AI if configured)

**Claude AI Usage** (when enabled):
- ⚠️ Extracted text sent to Anthropic API
- ⚠️ Not suitable for highly sensitive receipts
- ✅ No images sent (only extracted text)
- ✅ Documented in UI: "Using Claude AI + OCR..."

**Recommendations**:
- For personal use: AI mode is fine
- For sensitive business receipts: Consider OCR-only mode
- Production deployment: Use backend proxy for API key

   - Struggles with poor image quality
   - Handwritten text less accurate

2. **Language Support**
   - Currently: English + Chinese Simplified
   - Other languages need language packs
   - Mixed-language receipts may confuse OCR

3. **Processing Time**
   - Can take 5-15 seconds for large images
   - No cancellation mechanism currently
   - Blocks processing until complete

4. **Browser Requirements**
   - Requires Web Workers
   - Needs HTTPS for camera access
   - Large memory footprint (50-100 MB)

5. **Mobile Camera**
   - Some browsers don't support `capture="environment"`
   - Falls back to gallery on incompatible devices
   - Image compression needed for large photos

## Cost Considerations

### Tesseract.js (OCR)
- ✅ **Free and open source**
- ✅ No API costs
- ✅ Unlimited usage
- ⚠️ Client-side processing (battery/CPU)

### Claude AI (Parsing)
- 💰 **$0.001 - $0.002 per receipt**
- Based on text length extracted
- Optional (fallback available)
- Very affordable even for heavy users

**Monthly estimates**:
- 100 receipts/month: ~$0.10 - $0.20
- 500 receipts/month: ~$0.50 - $1.00
- 1000 receipts/month: ~$1.00 - $2.00

## User Benefits

1. **Speed**: Scanning is faster than manual entry
2. **Accuracy**: OCR reduces human error
3. **Convenience**: No need to type amounts and details
4. **Mobile-Friendly**: Take photos on the go
5. **Intelligent**: AI suggests categories automatically
6. **Privacy**: Processing happens locally (OCR)
7. **Offline-Capable**: OCR works without internet (AI needs connection)
